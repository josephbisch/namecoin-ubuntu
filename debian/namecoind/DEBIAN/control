Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Namecoin is a decentralized key/value registration and transfer system based
 on Bitcoin technology.
 .
 It can be used for multiple purposes, for example a secure and censorship
 resistant replacement for DNS.
 .
 Ownership of a name is based on ownership of a coin, which is in turn based
 on public key cryptography. The namecoin network reaches consensus every
 few minutes as to which names have been reserved or updated.
 .
 This package provides namecoind, a combined daemon and CLI tool to
 interact with the daemon.
